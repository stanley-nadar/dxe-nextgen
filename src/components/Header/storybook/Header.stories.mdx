# Header Component

The navigation is the topmost part of a web page that helps the user navigate a site. Use at the top of every page on
the website unless there is a special circumstance.

The Global Navigation contains a skip to main content button, this allows keyboard users to jump to the main content of
the page.

### Header Style

This control is seen inside the Template: Page content model. This allows the user to configure the Header to utilize a
dark background or minimal version of it. Due to Storybook's functionality, the only control that is provided is the
toggle between minimal and global nav for the time being.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Header" story={stories.componentHeader} />
</Canvas>

### Props

<ArgsTable story="Header" />
