# Generic Form

The Generic Form allows the Content Editor to generate a custom form and send any data over to the Freshmarketer
Endpoint.

## Forms

This contentful field allows the content editor to reference either a Form: Dropdown field or a Form: Input field. The
content editor can reference up to 10 Fields.

### Input Field

This is in reference to the Form: Input Field Content Model inside Contentful.

The `Type` field determines what type of input should the user input. It's crucial for this to be accurate as it helps
the user's experience. This is also tied to Validation.

The `Label` field captions the Input Field. Necessary for screen readers.

The `Placeholder` field specifies a hint that describes the expected value, it is recommended to always include this to
boosten user experience.

The `Helper Text` field defines text located under the Input Field to assist the user with the TextField functionality.

The `Start Icon` field defines the icon to be used at the start of the TextField. Visit Components -> Input Field to see
it in action.

The `End Icon` field defines the icon to be used at the end of the TextField. Visit Components -> Input Field to see it
in action.

The `Tool Tip Title` and `Tool Tip Description` only function when the Help End Icon is selected. They both appear if
the user hovers over the Help End Icon. Visit Components -> Input Field to see it in action.

For the Generic Form, the `Identification` field is what determines the name of the key that gets paired with the user
input value sent to the Freshmarketer.

### Dropdown Field

This is in reference to the Form: Dropdown Field Content Model inside Contentful.

The `Label` field captions the Input Field. Necessary for screen readers.
