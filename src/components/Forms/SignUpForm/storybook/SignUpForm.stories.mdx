# Signup Form

Note to User: Fields are disabled on storybook to prevent junk data being sent to Aloha API.

The Signup Form is mainly a pre-filled out form but it still gives Content Editors flexibility in regards to few details

The First & Last Name, Email, Company, and Phone Number field all reference the Form: Input Field Content Model. What
comes pre-configured is the identification and type. The Content Editor has the freedom to customize the label, Start
Icon, End Icon, and Tooltip Title and Description if necessary. See details below.

### Input Field

This is in reference to the Form: Input Field Content Model inside Contentful.

The `Label` field captions the Input Field. Necessary for screen readers.

The `Placeholder` field specifies a hint that describes the expected value, it is recommended to always include this to
boosten user experience.

The `Helper Text` field defines text located under the Input Field to assist the user with the TextField functionality.

The `Start Icon` field defines the icon to be used at the start of the TextField. Visit Components -> Input Field to see
it in action.

The `End Icon` field defines the icon to be used at the end of the TextField. Visit Components -> Input Field to see it
in action.

The `Tool Tip Title` and `Tool Tip Description` only function when the Help End Icon is selected. They both appear if
the user hovers over the Help End Icon. Visit Components -> Input Field to see it in action.

### Hidden Forms

This Contentful field allows the content editor to throw in invisible input fields in order to capture additional data
when a form gets submitted. The Form: Input Field gets referenced here.

The `Identification` field is what determines the name of the key that gets paired with the content editor provided
`Value` sent to the Freshmarketer.

The `Value` field can be any string that the Content Editor provides.
