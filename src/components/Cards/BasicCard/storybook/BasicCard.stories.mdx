# Basic Card

The Basic Card component comes in three main variants. They are the `standard`, `overlay`, and `longHeading` variants.
Each variant is visually unique and some even have unique attributes.

### Standard

The `standard` variant is the default variant that shows the `media` on the top and `category`, `heading`, and `body`
below. The `heading` is limited to 45 charactors and the body is truncated at two lines.

### Overlay

The `overlay` variant shows the `media` in full height with a slight black gradient on the bottom for readablity. It
also shows the `category` and `heading` but doesnt show the body until it had been hovered over. The body is NOT
truncated in this variation.

### Long Heading

the `longHeading` variation (aka the description card) is the most unique. It will NOT display the `heading` or the
`body` fields, but will instead display the `longHeading` & `date` fields. When in all sizes excpet `xxl`, `longHeading`
is truncated at three lines. When in `xxl` size, the long heading will be to the right of the media and be a max of 350
charactors.
