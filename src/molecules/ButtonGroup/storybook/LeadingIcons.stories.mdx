# Button Groups

Button groups combine sets of buttons into toolbars or split buttons for more complex components. Button groups are also
useful for acting as mini “tabs” in UI, for example, switching between date ranges.

### Its a wrapper

The buttons can be grouped by wrapping them with the `ButtonGroup` component.

- They need to be immediate children.
- There is no limit to the amount of Buttons you can add.
- All basic CSS props are available on both wrapper and button

## Leading Icons

Leading icons can be added to any and all buttons inside the `ButtonGroup` by adding the `startIcon` prop with a
ReactNode of your preferred icon.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Leading Icon" story={leadingIcon} />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Leading Icon" />
