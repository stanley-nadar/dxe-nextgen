# Button Groups

Button groups combine sets of buttons into toolbars or split buttons for more complex components. Button groups are also
useful for acting as mini “tabs” in UI, for example, switching between date ranges.

### Its a wrapper

The buttons can be grouped by wrapping them with the `ButtonGroup` component.

- They need to be immediate children.
- There is no limit to the amount of Buttons you can add.
- All basic CSS props are available on both wrapper and button

## No Icon

Simply adding buttons and using the default variant (outlined) will create the standard effect.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="No Icon" story={noIcon} />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="No Icon" />
