# Button Groups

Button groups combine sets of buttons into toolbars or split buttons for more complex components. Button groups are also
useful for acting as mini “tabs” in UI, for example, switching between date ranges.

### Its a wrapper

The buttons can be grouped by wrapping them with the `ButtonGroup` component.

- They need to be immediate children.
- There is no limit to the amount of Buttons you can add.
- All basic CSS props are available on both wrapper and button

## Icon Only

Icon only takes whichever `Icon` you prefer as a child for the supplied buttons.

**Note:** _that with the variation of sizes_ _in icons, the botton component makes use of the basic interpolation props
to adjust the padding size as needed._
