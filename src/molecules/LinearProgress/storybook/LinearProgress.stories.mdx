# Linear Progress

Progress indicators express an unspecified wait time or display the length of a process.

Progress indicators inform users about the status of ongoing processes, such as loading an app, submitting a form, or
saving updates.

- Determinate indicators display how long an operation will take.
- Indeterminate indicators visualize an unspecified wait time.

The animations of the components rely on CSS as much as possible to work even before the JavaScript is loaded.

## Usage

The default LinearProgress bar is a determinate bar with the options to take in a `value` and a `valueBuffer`.

### Values

Both `value` and `valueBuffer` take a number from 0-100. The `value` prop will determine the length of the primary
progress bar, while `valueBuffer` with determine the length of the buffer bar. By default, the `valueBuffer` prop is set
to 100, and using it us optional.

### Label

The optional `label` prop when `true` creates a percentage value of the current progress of the bar. The label can be in
4 differnt positions, either `end`, `bottom`, `track-top`, or `track-bottom`. The track positions create a hover badge
that follows the bar either on the top or bottom.

### Indeterminate

If the the wait time is unspecified the `indeterminate` and `query` varients can be used. These variants do not take a
`label`, or `value`.
