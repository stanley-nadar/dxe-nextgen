# Icons

This UI Library uses Feather Icons as its base, which has a total of 287 different icons. A
[complete searchable list](https://feathericons.com/) of all feather icons can be found within Feather documentation. As
well, The UI Library allows custom icons to be rendered through using SVG Sprites.

## Usage

## Base Icons

Base Icons are imported from React Feather. For example:

```tsx
import { Coffee } from 'react-feather';

<Container>
  <Coffee />
</Container>;
```

You can also pass these icons into any prop which accepts a `ReactNode`:

```tsx
import { Coffee } from 'react-feather';

const CoffeeButton = () => <Button endIcon={<Coffee />}>Click here for coffee!</Button>;
```

### Color

Each feather icon will inherit the `textColor` of its parent element and doing so is recommended in order to take
advantage of theme colors from quarks. However, feather icons can take a color prop that accepts any valid CSS color
arguments.

## Props

The props allow you to customize the icon you're displaying, including its `color`, `fill`, `width`, `height`, `stroke`,
`title`, and [many more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute).

```tsx
import { Coffee } from 'react-feather';

<Container textColor="primary-800">
  <Coffee stroke="#FFF" width={40} strokeWidth={2} title="Coffee Icon" />
</Container>;
```

## Freshwork Icons

Freshwork Icons are rendered by the Icon Molecule. The Icon Molecule has two required Props: `id` and `size` For
example:

```tsx
import Icon from 'molecules/Icon/icon';

<Container>
  <Icon id="automation" size={40} />
</Container>;
```

You can also pass these icons into any prop which accepts a `ReactNode`:

```tsx
import Icon from 'molecules/Icon/icon';

const RobotButton = () => <Button endIcon={<Icon id="automation" size={40} />}>I am Robot!</Button>;
```

<Story name="Icons" story={Icons} />

<ArgsTable story="Icons" />
