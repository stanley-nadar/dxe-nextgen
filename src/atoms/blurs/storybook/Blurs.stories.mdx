# Blurs

The Blur atom provides pre-defined blur values assignable to the `backdropFilter` props for use on quarks, molecules,
and components.

## Usage

The `backgroundFilter` prop takes a string that corresponds with a key defined in the Blur atom. For example:

```tsx
<Container backdropFilter="sm">I'm a Container. Inspect me!</Container>
```

This will render a `<div>` with `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)`, which is the default value set to "sm".

## Customization

To customize the Blur atom to fit your project's design system, simply change the values in `src/atoms/blurs/blurs.ts`.

## Backgrounds and Exceptions

As usual, Atoms can also be referenced as standard Javascript strings by importing them and passing them into the CSS
prop, although this is discouraged if avoidable.

In addition to the default "sizing" blur values, the blur atom also includes background values that can be referenced
via the CSS prop:

```tsx
import blur from 'atoms/blurs/blurs';

<Container
  css={`
    background-color: ${blur.background.dark};
  `}
>
  I'm a Container. Inspect me!
</Container>;
```

All available default blur values are viewable in the Canvas tab and you can experiment with them in the
[Container quark story](?path=/docs/quarks-container--container).
