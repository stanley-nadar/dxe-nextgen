# Breakpoints

The Breakpoints atom provides pre-defined breakpoint values to accommodate responsive design for different screen sizes.

## Usage

Each breakpoint in the breakpoints is automatically used to create a prop on all quarks. Each of those breakpoint props
take an object with key/value pairs corresponding with other quark props.

For example, if you want to change the margin and padding for a [Flex](?path=/story/quarks-flex--flex) quark when the
screen width is _greater_ than the `sm` breakpoint, it would be set like this:

```tsx
<Flex marginAll={8} paddingAll={8} sm={{ marginAll: 16, paddingAll: 16 }}>
  This quark is responsive!
</Flex>
```

The default value for the 'xs' breakpoint is `576px`, so this Flex will have larger padding and margin above that screen
width.

**Important:** The UI Library uses mobile-first responsive styling, but this can be changed by switching `min-width` to
`max-width` in the breakpoint atom.

## Customization

You can easily add breakpoints, remove breakpoints, and change breakpoint values by editing the `breakpoints` object in
`src/atoms/breakpoints/breakpoints.ts`.

All current Breakpoint keys and their size values can be seen on the Canvas tab.
