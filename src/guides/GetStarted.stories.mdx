# Welcome to the Freshworks UI Library!

The Freshworks UI Library is based on the Webstacks UI Library template repository built to quickly jump start new
React-based website projects.

<br />

## To start development

Install all necessary dependencies. This project uses `yarn` as its package manager.

```shell
# run these commands in your cli
yarn
yarn start
```

The Storybook contains a set of useful guide docs, design system definitions, live demos, and documentation for all
components included in the Freshworks UI Library.

To run Storybook locally, simply run:

```shell
yarn storybook
```

## Features

The Freshworks UI Library offers several features that make it easier to build new websites with. Full guides on them
exist in the Storybook.

1. **Atoms**: These are a code implementation of a design system. Values can be replaced easily and used across the
   project via quarks.
2. **Quarks**: These are essentially fully-featured [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) that implement
   atom values via React props.
3. **Molecules**: These are small React components mostly built using [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) that give you a
   head-start in building out your new site.
4. **Linting**: Fully fleshed out [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) rulesets are
   included which run on each commit via [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) and
   [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged).
5. **Documentation**: Every item in the UI Library is displayed on Storybook for easy demonstration for non-coders and
   includes an explanation of functionality.
6. **Type-safety**: The UI Library takes full advantage of Typescript and all types should be defined and used
   correctly.
