# Using Quarks

<br />

## What are Quarks?

Quarks are a system of styling components by implementing theme values stored in atoms. In simple terms: quarks are HTML
elements. There are quarks for `<div>` tags, for `<p>` and `<span>` tags, for `<img>` and `<a>` tags etc. But rather
than styling these elements using CSS classnames or by creating unique
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics), quarks are styled using a vast collection of React props
that correspond with CSS properties. Essentially, quarks are styled-components, but taken to their fullest extreme.

### Basic Usage

1. Import the quark you want. The below example uses `Container`, which is a standard `<div>` element.
2. Pass any CSS styles you want to the corresponding prop. The prop name is usually a camelcased version of the original
   CSS property.

```tsx
<Container maxWidth="100%">I'm a Container.</Container>
```

The above element will become a `<div>` with `max-width: 100%;`.

### Usage with Atom values

Most quark props simply implement the CSS property. But many others instead take values that correspond with theme
values defined in atoms. For example, color props take a string that correspond with a value in the
[color atom](?path=/story/atoms-colors--colors).

```tsx
<Container textColor="common-white">I'm a Container.</Container>
```

The above element will become a `<div>` with `color: #fff;`.

You can find full lists and explanations of each quark's props in the
[Quarks docs](?path=/story/quarks-container--container) in Storybook.

## Dark and Light Mode

Since color values in particular should naturally adjust depending on what mode the user is in, those props can take 2
types of values:

- a single string will represent that element's color at all times: `backgroundColor="common-black"`
- an object will represent that element's colors according to the corresponding mode:

```tsx
<Container backgroundColor={{ light: 'common-black', dark: 'common-white' }}>I'm a Container.</Container>
```

## Creating exceptions: CSS prop

You might be wondering - what if I want to add an exception? For example, add a hard-coded color value that should _not_
be defined in the color atom. For that purpose, this UI Library comes pre-installed with styled-components' babel
plugin, which offers the [css prop](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#css-prop). This can be used to add completely
custom CSS without using inline styling or constantly defining new styled components. The CSS prop allows for all normal
features of CSS props, including nesting, props, etc.

```tsx
<Container
  css={`
    color: '#90c9ff';
  `}
>
  I'm a Container.
</Container>
```

It even has access to the theme, which you can use to reference certain theme values if needed:

```tsx
<Container
  css={`
    color: ${props => (props.theme.palette.mode === 'dark' ? '#90c9ff' : '#fcfcfd')};
  `}
>
  I'm a Container.
</Container>
```

The above will render the component with a different color depending on whether or not dark mode is enabled.

Unfortunately Typescript has no way of detecting what type the `props` argument is when used within the CSS prop. So you
should import `CSSProps` from `theme/getAppTheme` and assign it to the prop argument. You can also destructure the
`props` argument to get `theme`, and use the same function body to set multiple styles:

```tsx
import { CSSProps } from 'theme/getAppTheme';

<Container
  css={`
    ${({ theme }: CSSProps) => `
        color: ${theme.palette.blue[100]};
        background-color: ${theme.palette.pink[100]};
      `}
  `}
>
  I'm a Container.
</Container>;
```

**Note:** Naturally, using the CSS prop is discouraged at all times except when absolutely necessary, since it disrupts
the design consistency provided by quarks.

## Responsive styling

The breakpoints defined in the [breakpoint atom](?path=/docs/atoms-breakpoints--breakpoints) are used to automatically
generate props which enable responsive styling via quarks. To use them, simply add a prop with a breakpoint name, then
pass in an object with keys and values just as you would a normal add styling with props.

```tsx
<Container
  width="100%"
  sm={{
    width: '50%',
  }}
>
  I'm a Container.
</Container>
```

The above example will be `width: 100%` at all view widths _up to_ the small (`sm`) breakpoint, at which point it will
be `width: 50%`.

**Note:** The UI Library uses mobile-first responsive styling, but this can be changed by switching `min-width` to
`max-width` in `atoms/breakpoints/breakpoints.ts`.

## Pseudo-classes

Just like with responsive styling, each common pseudoclass has its own prop which takes an object.

```tsx
<Container
  color="common-black"
  hover={{
    color: 'primary-400',
  }}
>
  I'm a Container.
</Container>
```

The above example will have a hover state using the color from `primary-400` in the color atom.

## Pseudo-elements

You probably get the idea by now. Each quark comes with `before` and `after` props you can use to create
pseudo-elements.

Keep in mind: pseudo-elements require a `content` property!

```tsx
<Container
  after={{
    content: 'I am a pseudo-element',
    color: 'primary-400',
  }}
>
  I'm a Container.
</Container>
```

## Use Quark props on any component

By default, all molecules and components in this library have the `basic` quark props available on them. That means for
example you can use the `marginAll` prop on the [BasicCard](?path=/story/components-cards-basic-card--basic-card)
component without needing to wrap it in a quark.

Implementing this on new components depends on whether your outermost element is a quark or accepts quark props. If it
is/does, you need only extend the prop types of your outermost element in your interface, then spread all
un-destructured props to the outermost element:

```tsx
import Container from 'quarks/Container'
import { BasicProps } from 'quarks/interpolations/basic';

interface BasicCardProps extends BasicProps {
  ...
}

const BasicCard: FC<BasicCardProps> = ({
  children,
  ...props
}) => {
  return (
    <Container {...props}>
      {children}
    </Container>
  )
}
```

If your outermost element is not a quark, for example if it's an MUI component, you can effectively turn it into a quark
by applying an interpolation to it:

```tsx
import { BasicProps, basic } from 'quarks/interpolations/basic';

const StyledButton = styled(MUIButton)`
  & {
    ${basic}
  }
`;
```

Then repeat the steps above as if it were a quark. You may need to add additional ampersands if you need to overcome
higher specificity in native styling.

## Adding new Quark props

Props are generated from a set of objects defined in `quarks/styleProps`. To add a new prop, simply add a new key
corresponding with the prop's name and with a function as its value. That function should take an argument corresponding
with the prop's value and return an interpolation using styled-components' `css` helper function. Here's an example in
`basicCSS`, which is used to generate props for all quarks.

```ts
const basicCSS = {
  height: (value: Properties['height']) => css`
    height: ${value};
  `,
  ...
}
```

## Why Quarks?

Quarks offer several advantages over other forms of styling:

1. **They enforce the website theme.** Normally, it's easier to hard-code style values on the fly than it is to
   consistently implement ones from the site's theme. This is problematic because it makes it difficult to change values
   uniformly and it allows for inconsistencies across the site. By making it trivial to implement theme values, quarks
   make this outcome much less likely (although still up to individual developers to use them).

2. **They are type-safe.** Using Typescript we can define what values are permitted for each style prop and enforce
   valid inputs with type checking. With Inellisense we can also provide hints and auto-completion to make references
   easier and reduce confusion. Otherwise, normal CSS or styled components are written as plain text, which cannot be
   easily parsed to check for proper types or syntax.

3. **They are highly dynamic.** Having each CSS property applied through props means developers get a high degree of
   control over conditional logic. Anything that can be done in Javascript can be applied to props.

```tsx
<Text
  textStyle="md"
  fontSize={size === 'small' ? 14 : 16}
  lineHeight={size === 'small' ? 20 : 24}
  alignSelf="flex-start"
>
  {label}
</Text>
```

Above is a simple example from the [Switch](?path=/docs/molecules-inputs-switch--switch) molecule that uses ternaries
based on the `size` prop from the encapsulating component to conditionally set the values for font size and line height.
But much more sophisticated logic can be used.

Once again, you can find full lists and explanations of each quark's props in the
[Quarks docs](?path=/story/quarks-container--container) in Storybook.
