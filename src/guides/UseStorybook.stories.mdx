# Using this Storybook

This Storybook hosts live demos of all molecules and components, guides and documentation, and other tools for
understanding the contents of the Freshworks UI Library.

## Viewing Stories

Each Quark, Atom, Molecule, and Component has its own story, which consists of two tabs found in the top left:

</Flex>

### Canvas tab

The Canvas tab demonstrates the item as it would be on a webpage. It is not present on guides like this one.

In addition to responding to user input and screen size changes, the item in the Canvas tab offers a panel at the bottom
if applicable. The panel comes in two parts:

- **Controls:** These allow you to see how the item changes depending on the props provided to it. For simple props like
  strings and numbers you can enter in the values directly. For more complex props like objects and arrays, a dropdown
  is provided with keys that map to different preset values. To reset the controls, simply click the "undo" button in
  the top right of the panel.

- **Actions:** For interactive elements such as buttons and input molecules that trigger events, those events will be
  logged in the Actions tab.

</Flex>

### Docs tab

The Docs tab contains detailed explanations of item properties, requirements, and behavior that are not readily apparent
in the Canvas tab. You are looking at a Doc tab right now!

When applicable, stories also contain a "Props" table which includes descriptions of all props and their default values
if set.

## The Toolbar

Alongside the Canvas and Docs tabs are several Storybook controls. They offer convenient features for understanding each
story:

### Light and Dark Toggle

This Storybook uses the [Dark Mode addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-dark-mode), which provides a toggle
on the far right of the toolbar. Although normally this toggle would affect both Storybook's UI itself and the canvas
tab, it has been disabled in the canvas tab on this project since components are not designed with dark mode in mind.

### Other Toolbar controls

From left to right, other useful controls include:

- Zoom in
- Zoom out
- Zoom reset
- Toggle grid background
- Responsiveness - This allows you to choose the screen size within the Canvas tab
- Measure - This enables an overlay which shows sizes and distances between each element
- Outlines - Enables a wireframe to show item positioning
